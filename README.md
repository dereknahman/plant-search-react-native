## How to run this project on your machine

- Please follow the [set-up instructions for React Native projects](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- Clone this repo.
- Run `yarn install` in your terminal from wherever you saved the cloned repo.
- `cd ios && pod install` if you'll be running the app on iOS. Then `cd` back to the project root.

- Run `yarn run ios` or `yarn run android`, depending on your preference.

- It would be cool to have the ability to bookmark plants.
- Perhaps a user sign-in, but maybe that's overkill.
- I definitely want to spend some time making it beautiful. The current styling was whipped up in about 30minutes - it shows ðŸ˜….
