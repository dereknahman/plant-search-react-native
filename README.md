# plant-search-react-native

I made this app because I was feeling a little despondent about my skills and wanted to reignite my love for programming again. I'm glad to say it helped a lot. Built using React Native and the wonderful Trefle API.
## How to run this project on your machine

- Please follow the [set-up instructions for React Native projects](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
- Clone this repo.
- Run `yarn install` in your terminal from wherever you saved the cloned repo.
- Get your own personal access token (API key) from [Trefle](https://docs.trefle.io/docs/guides/getting-started/) and copy it into a new file that you create called `.env` in the root of the project. Copy the name and syntax from the `.env.example` file *exactly*. Your API key doesn't need to wrapped in quote marks.
- Run `yarn run ios` or `yarn run android`, depending on your preference.
## Things I'll be adding soon

- I really want it to be as accessible as can be. To my shame I don't know very much about a11y on mobile apps yet, so this will be an ongoing project.
- I'm going to add a plant detail screen so that users can click the images and find out more about the plants.
- I need to refactor the code into components where it makes sense to.
- I want to add a splash screen.
- It would be cool to have the ability to bookmark plants.
- Perhaps a user sign-in, but maybe that's overkill.
- I definitely want to spend some time making it beautiful. The current styling was whipped up in about 30minutes - it shows 😅.
